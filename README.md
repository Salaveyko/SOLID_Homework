# Just a SOLID principles reminder :)
### Single-responsibility principle
>A module should be responsible to one, and only one, actor.
### Open–closed principle
>Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
### Liskov substitution principle
>Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.
### Interface segregation principle
>A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
### Dependency inversion principle
> There was no task here, so I used my imagination and created a Factory.
